## Introduction and Dataset
This project develops an automated classification and anomaly detection system for pulmonary function images using deep learning, aiming to identify standardized images and flag irregular ones from COVID-19 pandemic-related data (including healthy, viral pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases). (For dataset download, please refer to Kaggle.)

## Implemente
Implemented with Python and PyTorch, it uses torchvision for data processing and Matplotlib for visualization. Tests on SimpleCNN, ResNet18, and ResNet34 show SimpleCNN performs best (98.48% accuracy), followed by ResNet34 (92.39% accuracy).

It provides a reliable solution for automated pulmonary function image analysis. See the full "Covid19.doc" report for details.
